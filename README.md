# CENG311 Computer Architecture Lab Work

* In the scope of this course. We have used Tolga Ayav "Design_Notes_of_Microprocessor_u311_1.pdf" document 
to understand how a microprocessor can be designed, implemented, programmed, enhanced and debugged.

* ModelSim was used for the simulation environment.

* Full documentation can be reached by following below link:
